# Introspected APIs
(Sliding away from Roy Fielding's REST model)

## Introduction

## Ideal REST API
> A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI (bookmark)
> and set of standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience
> (i.e., expected to be understood by any client that might use the API).
>
> From that point on, all application state transitions must be driven by client
> selection of server-provided choices that are present in the received representations
> or implied by the user’s manipulation of those representations.
>
> The transitions may be determined (or limited by) the client’s knowledge of media
> types and resource communication mechanisms, both of which may be improved
> on-the-fly (e.g., code-on-demand).
